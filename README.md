# wordle_challenge
This is a challenge to potential applicants to produce a Wordle Solver in SQL.
The Instructions.pdf file has the details.

Note:  The idea is to write your proc so that it is the best possible solution for any one word (on average).  Your code should not assume that every word will be played only once, even though I will in fact be solving every word only a single time to test your solution.   Thank you to Satish More for pointing this out!
